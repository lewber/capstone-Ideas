NBA Basketball

Which NBA player has the best chance to become the scoring champion for the 2017-18 season?

For this project we will analyze player data from across the NBA then employ the appropriate models to create our conclusion. NBA executives for each team can use this information to anticipate spikes or declines in team revenue. If a player leads the league in scoring this has a positive affect on ticket sales, jersey sales and TV primetime exposure.


We will analyze data from the sites below and continue to search for csv files:
