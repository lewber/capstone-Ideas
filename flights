Flight delays are often times frustrating and can greatly affect airline revenue as well as customer loyalty
or future business


We will analyze flight data for various airlines and determine how many flights will be delayed for the 4th quarter
of 2017, the results of the project will help airlines implement new strategies to reduce delay percentages and thus
increase revenue
